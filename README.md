# Requirements Engineering Knowledge Catalog System - Documentation

## Overview

This system provides a hierarchical, machine-readable catalog for requirements engineering frameworks and their definitions. It's designed to support LLM-based requirements classification by providing structured knowledge about various requirement types and their characteristics according to different frameworks.

It is a supporting feature that I plan to integrate into the NFR Elicitation AI Assistant in the future, at least partially.

### Key Features
- Hierarchical organization of requirement categories
- Multiple framework definitions per category
- Keyword-based search capabilities
- Framework comparison tools
- LLM-ready query interface
- JSON/YAML serialization support
